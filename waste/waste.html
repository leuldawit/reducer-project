            Waste Shredding and Secondary Fuel Production for Waste-to-Energy
          </h1>
          <p>
            Waste is a valuable material. Whether commercial waste, bulky or
            household waste, production rejects, rejects and paper, municipal
            waste, wood residues and carpet materials: WEIMA ensures
            high-throughput waste shredding and an optimal result in the
            extraction of valuable secondary fuels (RDF).
          </p>
          <p>
            Robustly designed pre-shredders and shredders are used worldwide as
            a stand-alone solution or as part of a multi-stage waste treatment
            plant. The output material from different material fractions is
            ideally suited for the production of high-calorific alternative
            fuels (RDF). These are in particularly high demand for the
            production of energy for the cement industry.

                    With our shredding solutions we would like to contribute to
                    the fact that waste that is no longer usable, but
                    nevertheless valuable, does not find its way to the landfill
                    site, but is used for energy generation. In doing so, the
                    use of fossil fuels is further reduced, which protects the
                    environment and is usually more economical.

                  <h3>Use of alternative fuels in cement production</h3>
                  <p>
                    The cement industry has a very high demand for energy. This
                    can increasingly be covered by substitute fuels. The focus
                    is on the combustion of alternative fuels in calciners,
                    pre-burners and kilns. In order to reduce energy costs,
                    cement manufacturers are placing more and more emphasis on
                    increasing the proportion of alternative fuels in energy
                    production. Compared to classic materials, the thermal
                    utilization of these fuels has better physical burning
                    properties and better burnout in the kiln. In general, the
                    better the secondary fuel used, the more efficient the
                    production of high-quality clinker.

                    The production of cement requires enormous amounts of
                    energy. To cover this sustainably, the use of secondary
                    fuels is crucial. But co-processing is more than simply

                  <h3>Definition: What is co-processing?</h3>
                  <p>
                    The term co-processing describes a globally recognized
                    technology used in energy-intensive industries (EII) such as
                    cement production to recycle waste and industrial
                    by-products for energy and materials. The mineral components
                    in the waste replace primary raw materials (e.g. limestone)
                    in the cement kiln, while the combustible materials provide
                    the necessary energy for the production of clinker. No
                    residual materials are produced in the process, and highly
                    toxic wastes are also destroyed. Co-processing thus makes it
                    possible to avoid landfilling and incineration of wastes
                    such as sewage sludge, solvents, plastics from industry or
                    mineral wastes.

                  <h3>Advantages of Co-Processing</h3>
                  <p>
                    Co-processing in the context of cement production has many
                    advantages: The extremely high temperatures and long
                    residence time in the kiln completely destroy even hazardous
                    and toxic waste. No residual materials are produced that
                    have to be further recycled or landfilled. The use of
                    co-processing technology also avoids the need to use fossil
                    fuels and consequently reduces greenhouse gas emissions. In
                    addition, cement manufacturers can massively reduce their
                    energy costs thanks to secondary fuels from waste.

                  <p>
                    Generally, waste cannot directly processed in cement kilns,
                    but must be prepared beforehand. The treatment process, also
                    called pre-processing, includes the shredding, mixing and
                    drying of waste. The use of WEIMA shredders in
                    pre-processing enables consistently homogeneous particle
                    sizes of the most demanding material. This guarantees a
                    stable fuel that meets the technical requirements of cement
                    production.

                  <p>
                    WEIMA waste shredders are ideally suited for the production
                    of medium and high calorific RDF (refuse derived fuel).
                    These are fuels that are obtained from household, industrial
                    and municipal waste. The different quality requirements
                    depend on the thermal process. The typical processing steps
                    of the high-calorific fraction include pre-sorting,
                    pre-shredding, air separation and metal separation. Sensory
                    sorting and drying are also possible. In most cases
                    substitute fuel is used together with conventional fuels,
                    e.g. in cement, lime, coal and industrial power plants.

                    collected in bags or garbage cans and collected by municipal
                    or private waste service providers. This does not include
                    commercial or industrial waste. While the organic components
                    can be composted or otherwise made biologically usable, the
                    majority of municipal household waste serves as an
                    alternative fuel for various energy-intensive industries.

                  <p>
                    Generally speaking, this is household waste, MSW or
                    commercial waste similar to household waste. This is first
                    collected by waste management companies and transported to a
                    central location for waste treatment, disposal or recycling.
                    Typically, household waste contains a high proportion of
                    organic substances. After a coarse pre-sifting, it is
                    shredded and then divided into different fractions by
                    screening. The coarse fraction (foil, paper, hard plastics,
                    wood, etc.) is mostly used as fuel in RDF power plants due
                    to its high caloric value. The fine fraction (organic
                    substances), on the other hand, is usually treated further
                    biologically. Gases produced in this way can be used to
                    generate energy.

                    The production of SRF usually requires additional process
                    steps, as higher quality requirements for its production
                    have been defined at European level. The essential
                    properties of a classification include the calorific value
                    as well as the chlorine and mercury content. This results in
                    five quality classes to be able to call processed waste

                    The WEIMA show room is equipped with shredding and
                    briquetting machines of all sizes and technologies. This
                    enables us to simulate your application as realistically as
                    possible. You have the possibility to send us your material
                    or visit us directly in Ilsfeld. From our gallery you have
                    the best view directly into the cutting chamber. So you can
                    observe the shredding process live.
